        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Khyati Kumari, and I am from Nawada, Bihar. I have a passion for exploring new things, dancing, and painting, which keeps me creatively engaged. I am proficient in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Node JS, and SQL. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with web development, data structures and algorithms, IoT, TinkerCad, Google Cloud, NLP, AI-ML, Microsoft Office, and OpenCV.<br>

            Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that have honed my technical and interpersonal skills. Notable projects include a Weather Search App, Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV, Smart Irrigation System, Margdarshak, Virtual Trading Web Application, and a Lost and Found Web Application. Two of these projects were group efforts, which significantly improved my team management and problem-solving abilities.<br>
            
            I was recently selected as the 2nd runner-up in the InnoHack2.0 hackathon and have earned certifications in web development, machine learning fundamentals, Azure AI, data visualization, and network security. I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team. Thank you for considering my application.
